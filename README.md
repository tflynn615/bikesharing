## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the Citi bike's business proposal in order to create a solid presentation for investors.  

## Results 
To tell this story, we decided to evaluate average user data and dive deeper into this data by user gender: 

- Citi bike is a strong opportunity with a growing user base that already sees heavy usage in the center of New York City with some users expanding into outer areas.

- We start the analysis by looking at the average length of trip for all bike trips. It appears that most users finish their trip within 30 min.

- Double clicking into this data, we see that the number of Men with trips of about 10 min greatly outnumber those by Women and Unknown genders.
